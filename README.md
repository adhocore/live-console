## Live Console for PHP

Probably, it is the smallest live PHP console that is also SPA.

Just fiddle in your PHP codes in upper box, and hit `go` button! 
The output is shown in lower box. 


### PS: 
- How its size became just 666b is really amazing!
- It is meant for handy execution of simple PHP code snippets
- Do not abuse it by heavy/long codes.


Thats all
